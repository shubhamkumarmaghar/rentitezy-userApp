That’s why we are taking steps to enable you to access, receive a copy of, update, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information.</p><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Individuals located in certain jurisdictions, including the European Economic Area, California, and other US states that have enacted consumer privacy laws, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. Specifically, they have the following rights:</p><ul _ngcontent-fnr-c22=""><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right of access: you have the right to obtain confirmation that your personal data is processed, and in the case of processing, information regarding the purposes of your data processing, the retention period (and the criteria used to determine this period) of the data, the recipients to whom your personal data has been or will be disclosed, and a copy of your personal data that we maintain.</li><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right to data portability: you have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</li><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right to rectification or correction: you have the right to obtain rectification of any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we maintain about you.</li><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right to erasure (right to be forgotten): you have the right, in some circumstances, to obtain the erasure of the personal data that we maintain about you. The right to be forgotten is not unreservedly guaranteed. It is limited especially when colliding with the right of freedom of expression and information. Other exceptions are if the processing of data which is subject to an erasure request is necessary to comply with legal obligations, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes or for the defence of legal claims.</li><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right to restriction of processing: you have the right, in some circumstances, to obtain restriction of processing to the personal data that we maintain about you.</li><li _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Right to object: you have the right to object to any processing of your personal data that we maintain, but there may be compelling reasons for continuing this processing from our side. In any case we will assess your request and respond to you accordingly. Marketing activities are not included in the aforementioned compelling reasons.</li></ul><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Before disclosing the requested records of Personal Information we keep of you, we may ask you for additional information in order to confirm your identity and for security purposes. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law (e.g., if your request is unfounded or excessive).</p><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Rentiseazy does not “sell” or “share” your Personal Information as we understand those terms are used under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act.</p><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">If you believe that Rentiseazy has failed to take appropriate action in responses to your privacy rights request, you have the right to appeal and can do so by contact us as described below.

Information security and privacy incident reporting</span><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">We implement reasonable organizational and technical measures in order to safeguard your Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, change or damage. Having said that, no security program is 100% foolproof and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.</p><span _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">8. Interest-based advertising</span><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">We participate in interest-based advertising. This means that when you use the Services, we or third party service providers or advertisers may use cookies (that they collect or that we provide to them) or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services (including mobile applications) or your online activities over time and across different websites and devices. Collected information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, and the website that referred you to the Services, and this information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or Internet Protocol (IP) address.

If you do not wish to receive such promotional messages or calls, you may notify us at any time or follow the “unsubscribe” link. We take steps to limit the promotional content we send you to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you information which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on your information.</p><p _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">Also, we may contact you with important information regarding our Services, or your use thereof. For example, we may send you billing information; replies to your support ticket or email; send you reminders or warnings regarding upcoming or late payments for your current or upcoming subscriptions; or notify you of material changes in our Services. It is important that you are always able to receive such messages. For this reason, you are not able to opt-out of receiving such Service and Billing Messages unless you are no longer a Rentiseazy Visitor or User.</p><span _ngcontent-fnr-c22="">10.
